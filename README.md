## A simple game server for room arrangement

### Features
* Generalized room arrangement service for games (still conceptual)
* Keep-alive socket based, no server container needed
* Communication between clients and servers totally based on JSON
* Register-notify model (rather than polling) and version check for updating room information
* Should be thread safe with lock mechanism
